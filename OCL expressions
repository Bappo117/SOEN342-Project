1. “Offerings are unique. In other words, multiple offerings on the same day and time slot must be offered at a different location.”
context Offering
inv     Offering.allInstances()->forAll(o1, o2 |
        o1 <> o2 implies o1.timeSlot <> o2.timeSlot or
                       o1.dateRange <> o2.dateRange or
                       o1.location <> o2.location
    )

2. “Any client who is underage must necessarily be accompanied by an adult who acts as their guardian.”
context Client
inv self.age < 18 implies
        Guardian.allInstances()->exists(g | g.client = self)


3. “The city associated with an offering must be one the city’s that the instructor has indicated in their availabilities.”
context Offering
inv self.instructor.citiesAvailable->includes(self.location.city)





4. “A client does not have multiple bookings on the same day and time slot.” (for simplicity we consider only identical day and time slots, even though in reality a booking on Monday 3pm – 4pm and another also on Monday 3:30pm – 4:30pm should not be acceptable.)
context Client
inv  self.bookings->forAll(b1, b2 |
        b1 <> b2 implies b1.offering.timeSlot <> b2.offering.timeSlot or
                         b1.offering.dateRange <> b2.offering.dateRange
    )
